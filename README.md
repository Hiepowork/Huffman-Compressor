# Huffman-Compressor
This was a projec that I completed during my CS 314 Data Structures and Algorithms course at the University of Texas at Austin. It is a Huffman File compressor that uses 
Huffman Coding in order to achieve lossless file compression. To use, simply run the Huff.java file. It will compress into a .hf file that when decompressed is still
a .hf file. The program in itself isn't that useful, but was good for me to learn how compression of files works.
